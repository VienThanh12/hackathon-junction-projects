# Junction - Hackathon Project

## BIM for any building, by anyone.

### Challenge

The key challenge is that there is no easy-to-use tool to:

- üìê **Create simple, recognizable 3D building models** based on limited input parameters, such as building address, 2D floor plans, and floor heights.
- üèó **Import, position, and orient 3D equipment models**, especially elevators, within the building model using a drag-and-drop interface.
- üîÑ **Export models and components** (e.g., equipment) into a standard 3D file format for further use in digital twin applications.

# Overview

## Main page

KONE 3DNow is based on the KONE main page. It showcases an initial 3D model of the building where elevator and equipment models are integrated to create a live digital twin.

### Add Floor Heights (in meters)

Define the height of each floor in the building and adjust the number of floors as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm** are required to run the React frontend. You can download them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### üöÄ Quick Start

#### Option 1: Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VienThanh12/hackathon-junction-projects.git
   cd hackathon-junction-projects
   ```

   - If your machine cannot reach Gitlab at this stage and nothing happens, it's a sign of a firewall issue between your machine and Github.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App Locally**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application in your browser**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Option 2: Using docker

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VienThanh12/hackathon-junction-projects.git
   cd hackathon-junction-projects
   ```

   - If your machine cannot reach Gitlab at this stage and nothing happens, it's a sign of a firewall issue between your machine and Github.

2. **Using docker compose to run the app**

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Open the application in your browser**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Known Issues

1. **Backend and Frontend Communication Not Yet Established**

   - Due to the complexity of handling 3D models, we focused on the frontend and AI model training first. With limited time in the Junction hackathon, backend connections are still pending but will be completed soon.

2. **AI Model Still in Development**

   - Our initial model is trained on a small dataset. Future versions will use larger datasets to improve performance.

3. **UI Improvements Needed**

   - Initial efforts focused on functionality over design. UI enhancements are planned for future updates.

4. **Exporting 2D and 3D Pictures from 3D View Not Available Yet**

   - This feature is in development and will be included in a future release.
