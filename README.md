# Junction - Hackathon Project

## Overview

### BIM for any building, by anyone.

# Challenge

The key challenge is that there is no easy-to-use tool to:

- Create a simple and identifiable 3D model of the building based on a limited set of input parameters available such as the building address and/or 2D floor plans, and floor heights
- Import, position and orient existing equipment 3D models, especially elevators to the 3D model of the building with drag-and-drop type of process.
- Export the model and its components (e.g., equipment) into a standard 3D file format for further processing, e.g., deploying the model as part of a digital twin application.

## Main page

KONE 3DNow is based on the KONE main page. It is supposed to showcase the initial 3D model of the building into which the elevators and related equipment models will be integrated for a live building twin.

## Input parameters 2D plans

## Add floor height/s (in meters)

The next input, floor number height, we can define the height of every floor in the building. We can modify the number of floors.

# Key Features

1. üñºÔ∏è **Upload 2D and 3D Images**

   - Allows uploading both 2D and 3D images, providing flexibility in content type.

2. üìù **Convert 2D to 3D Images**

   - Uses AI to transform 2D images into 3D, adding depth and dimension to flat images.

3. üèó **Import and Position, Scale of 3D Models**

   - Drag-and-drop functionality for adding, positioning, and orienting 3D models of equipment, like elevators, into building models for a seamless integration experience.

4. üîç **Export Images in 2D (PNG) and 3D (PLY) Formats**

   - Enables exporting images in both 2D and 3D formats for various applications.

5. üåê **Web Deployment**

   - Access the platform from anywhere, ensuring broad availability and ease of use.

6. üìê **Reponsive Design**

   - The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

7. üìç ** 3D Modeling Existing**
   - 3D modeling of existing trucks, elevator, allowing users to create accurate and detailed digital representations of their structures.

# Getting Started

To make it easy for you to get started with Github, here's a list of recommended next steps.

## Prerequisites

- You‚Äôll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to run the React frontend. You can download them from the official website: Node.js.

## üöÄ Quick start

### Option 1:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VienThanh12/hackathon-junction-projects.git
   cd hackathon-junction-projects
   ```

   - If your machine cannot reach Gitlab at this stage and nothing happens, it's a sign of a firewall issue between your machine and Github.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App Locally**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the application in your browser**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Option 2: Using docker

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VienThanh12/hackathon-junction-projects.git
   cd hackathon-junction-projects
   ```

   - If your machine cannot reach Gitlab at this stage and nothing happens, it's a sign of a firewall issue between your machine and Github.

2. **Using docker compose to run the app**

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Open the application in your browser**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
